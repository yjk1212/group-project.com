      <h2>Equipment cost performance selection</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 series or Intel Core i5 series, which have high performance and reasonable price.</li>
        <li>Motherboard: Select a motherboard that is compatible with the CPU and make sure it has the required ports and expansion slots.</li>
        <li>Memory: 8GB or 16GB DDR4 memory, which is sufficient for most applications.</li>
        <li>Hard drives: 256GB or 512GB solid-state drives (SSDS), these hard drives offer faster boot speeds and shorter load times.</li>
        <li>Video card: If you need graphics processing, gaming, or video editing, it's better to choose a computer with a separate video card. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT are some of the better options.</li>
        <li>Power Supply: Choose a power supply that provides enough power, such as 450 watts or 550 watts, to meet the needs of most computers.</li>
