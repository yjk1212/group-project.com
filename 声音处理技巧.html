        <li>Choose the right sound effects: Choosing sound effects that match the content of the video can enhance the atmosphere and emotional expression of the video. You can choose ready-made sound effects from a sound library, or record your own.</li>
        <li>Adjust volume and balance: Different sound effects in a video need to have different volume and balance to achieve the best effect. In general, the sound should not be too loud, or it will affect the audience's auditory experience.</li>
        <li>Adjust the time and position of the sound effects: Adjust the sound effects to the appropriate time and position according to the video content and scene, so that the sound effects and the picture can be coordinated and unified.
        </li>
       <li>Add reverb effects: Adding reverb effects to sound effects enhances the sense of layer and space, making the sound more natural and realistic.
    </li>
    <li>Remove noise: There may be some noise in the video, such as electronic noise, background noise, etc., which can affect the quality of the sound. Noise reduction tools can be used to remove these noises and improve the quality of sound effects.</li>
    <li>Add background music: Appropriate background music can enhance the emotional expression of a video and the viewer's viewing experience. Select background music that matches the content of the video, and adjust the volume, duration, and balance parameters as necessary.</li>
