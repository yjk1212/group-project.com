       <h2>Some keys</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Shoot sharp images: Choose sharp, colorful, contrasting materials. Before shooting, make sure the camera is set up correctly to avoid issues such as overexposure, underexposure, or out of focus.</li>
        <li>Stable picture: Use equipment such as a tripod or stabilizer whenever possible to ensure a stable picture. Don't use a handheld camera or an unstable platform, which can make the picture shaky or blurry.</li>
        <li>Choose material that makes sense: Choose material that allows the audience to better understand what you are trying to say. Avoid using meaningless or irrelevant material that will distract the audience.</li>
        <li>Variety of footage: Choose different types and scenes of footage to increase the appeal and visual effect of the video.</li>
        <li>Legal material: Make sure there are no copyright issues with the material you use. Using unauthorized material can lead to legal disputes, so make sure what you're using is legal.</li>
        <li>Avoid overhandling your material: When editing and manipulating your material, avoid overhandling techniques like special effects and filters, which can make the material look overdone and unreal.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In conclusion, choosing good video material takes some skill and experience, but with practice and practice, you will be able to better select and use your material to produce high quality videos.</p>
