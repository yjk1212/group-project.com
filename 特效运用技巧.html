     <p>Special effects in video clips can add more dynamic and visual impact to the video. Here are some tips to use them</p>
<ol>
    <li>Transition effects: Effects often used in video clips to enhance the coherence and flow of the video. Common transition effects include fade in and fade out, blinds, flash white, and so on.</li>
    <li>Filter effects: Filters can adjust the color and light of the video to increase the color and light feel of the video. For example, you can use a bright filter to brighten a video, or a blue filter to create a cool tone effect.</li>
    <li>Pixelated effects: Videos can be pixelated to create a blurry or hand-painted effect. This effect is often used in animation or cartoon-style videos.
    </li>
    <li>Text effects: Text effects can be added to enhance the message and performance of the video. For example, you can use stroke, glow, flicker and other effects to emphasize text.</li>
    <li>Zoom effects: Zoom the size of the video to create visual impact. For example, you can use gradually zooming in and out to increase the sense of drama and tension.</li>
    <li>Mirror effects: You can use mirror flip to create unique visual effects. For example, videos can be flipped vertically or horizontally, or part of the image can be flipped to create a sense of symmetry.</li>
    <li>Texture effects: Add textures such as graphics and pictures to make videos more artistic and creative. For example, you can use maps to add graphics or text, or vector graphics to create abstract effects.</li>
